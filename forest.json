It first uses an LLM's feedback to automatically design rewards corresponding to each skill, starting from their natural language description. Then, it employs an LLM's code generation abilities, together with reinforcement learning, for training the skills and combining them to implement complex behaviors specified in language.

Recent works have made promising steps by exploiting the prior knowledge of large language models (LLMs). However, these approaches suffer from important limitations: they are either not scalable to problems requiring billions of environment samples, due to requiring LLM annotations for each observation, or they require a diverse offline dataset, which may not exist or be impossible to collect. In this work, we address these limitations through a combination of algorithmic and systems-level contributions. We propose ONI, a distributed architecture that simultaneously learns an RL policy and an intrinsic reward function using LLM feedback. Our approach annotates the agent's collected experience via an asynchronous LLM server, which is then distilled into an intrinsic reward model. We explore a range of algorithmic choices for reward modeling with varying complexity, including hashing, classification, and ranking models. By studying their relative tradeoffs, we shed light on questions regarding intrinsic reward design for sparse reward problems. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of challenging, sparse reward tasks from the NetHack Learning Environment in a simple unified process, solely using the agent's gathered experience, without requiring external datasets.

To address this, we introduce GVFExplorer, which adaptively learns a single behavior policy that efficiently collects data for evaluating multiple GVFs in parallel. Our method optimizes the behavior policy by minimizing the total variance in return across GVFs, thereby reducing the required environmental interactions. We use an existing temporal-difference-style variance estimator to approximate the return variance. We prove that each behavior policy update decreases the overall mean squared error in GVF predictions.

More recent methods for learning SFs can avoid representation collapse, but they often involve complex losses and multiple learning phases, reducing their efficiency. We introduce a novel, simple method for learning SFs directly from pixels.

Streaming learning, the modus operandi of classic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like Q-learning and TD, mimics natural learning by using the most recent sample without storing it. This approach is also ideal for resourceconstrained, communication-limited, and privacy-sensitive applications. However, in deep RL, learners almost always use batch updates and replay buffers, making them computationally expensive and incompatible with streaming learning. Although the prevalence of batch deep RL is often attributed to its sample efficiency, a more critical reason for the absence of streaming deep RL is its frequent instability and failure to learn, which we refer to as stream barrier. This paper introduces the stream-x algorithms, the first class of deep RL algorithms to overcome stream barrier for both prediction and control and match sample efficiency of batch RL. Through experiments in Mujoco Gym, DM Control Suite, and Atari Games, we demonstrate stream barrier in existing algorithms and successful stable learning with our stream-x algorithms: stream Q, stream AC, and stream TD, achieving the best model-free performance in DM Control Dog environments. A set of common techniques underlies the stream-x algorithms, enabling their success with a single set of hyperparameters and allowing for easy extension to other algorithms, thereby reviving streaming RL.},\n primaryclass = {cs},\n eprint = {2410.14606},\n month = {October}\n}"}},"leeRLAIFVsRLHF2024":{"title":"RLAIF vs. RLHF: Scaling Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with AI Feedback","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"leeRLAIFVsRLHF2024.xml","metas":{"external":"Https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00267","bibtex":"@Misc{leeRLAIFVsRLHF2024,\n title = {{{RLAIF}} vs. {{RLHF}}: {{Scaling Reinforcement Learning}} from {{Human Feedback}} with {{AI Feedback}}},\n author = {Lee, Harrison and Phatale, Samrat and Mansoor, Hassan and Mesnard, Thomas and Ferret, Johan and Lu, Kellie and Bishop, Colton and Hall, Ethan and Carbune, Victor and Rastogi, Abhinav and Prakash, Sushant},\n year = {2024},\n urldate = {2024-09-11},\n number = {arXiv:2309.00267},\n publisher = {arXiv},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/IWPVFZCM/Lee et al. - 2024 - RLAIF vs. RLHF Scaling Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with AI Feedback.pdf},\n keywords = {Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,Computer Science - Computation and Language,Computer Science - Machine Learning},\n langid = {english},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n abstract = {Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, but gathering high-quality preference labels is expensive.

Furthermore, we take a step towards ``self-improvement'' by demonstrating that RLAIF can outperform a supervised finetuned baseline even when the AI labeler is the same size as the policy, or even the exact same checkpoint as the initial policy.

In this work, we propose unsupervised-to-online RL (U2O RL), which replaces domain-specific supervised offline RL with unsupervised offline RL, as a better alternative to offline-to-online RL. U2O RL not only enables reusing a single pre-trained model for multiple downstream tasks, but also learns better representations, which often result in even better performance and stability than supervised offline-to-online RL. To instantiate U2O RL in practice, we propose a general recipe for U2O RL to bridge task-agnostic unsupervised offline skill-based policy pre-training and supervised online fine-tuning.

In particular, we investigate two new regularization techniques for continual learning: (i) Wasserstein regularization toward the initial weight distribution, which is less restrictive than regularizing toward initial weights; and (ii) regularizing weight matrix singular values, which directly ensures gradient diversity is maintained throughout training. We present an experimental analysis that shows these alternative regularizers can improve continual learning performance across a range of supervised learning tasks and model architectures. The alternative regularizers prove to be less sensitive to hyperparameters while demonstrating better training in individual tasks, sustaining trainability as new tasks arrive, and achieving better generalization performance.},\n primaryclass = {cs},\n eprint = {2406.06811},\n month = {June}\n}"}},"myersLearningTemporalDistances2024":{"title":"Learning Temporal Distances: Contrastive Successor Features Can Provide a Metric Structure for Decision-Making","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"myersLearningTemporalDistances2024.xml","metas":{"doi":"10.48550/ArXiv.2406.17098","external":"Https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17098","bibtex":"@Misc{myersLearningTemporalDistances2024,\n title = {Learning {{Temporal Distances}}: {{Contrastive Successor Features Can Provide}} a {{Metric Structure}} for {{Decision-Making}}},\n author = {Myers, Vivek and Zheng, Chongyi and Dragan, Anca and Levine, Sergey and Eysenbach, Benjamin},\n year = {2024},\n doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2406.17098},\n urldate = {2024-09-06},\n number = {arXiv:2406.17098},\n publisher = {arXiv},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/X3LR92NR/Myers et al. - 2024 - Learning Temporal Distances Contrastive Successor Features Can Provide a Metric Structure for Decis.pdf},\n keywords = {Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,Computer Science - Machine Learning},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n abstract = {Temporal distances lie at the heart of many algorithms for planning, control, and reinforcement learning that involve reaching goals, allowing one to estimate the transit time between two states.

This is not merely a definitional concern, but translates to an inability to generalize and find shortest paths. In this paper, we build on prior work in contrastive learning and quasimetrics to show how successor features learned by contrastive learning (after a change of variables) form a temporal distance that does satisfy the triangle inequality, even in stochastic settings. Importantly, this temporal distance is computationally efficient to estimate, even in high-dimensional and stochastic settings. Experiments in controlled settings and benchmark suites demonstrate that an RL algorithm based on these new temporal distances exhibits combinatorial generalization (i.e., \"stitching\") and can sometimes learn more quickly than prior methods, including those based on quasimetrics.},\n primaryclass = {cs},\n eprint = {2406.17098},\n month = {June},\n shorttitle = {Learning {{Temporal Distances}}}\n}"}},"qiOnlineDPOOnline2024":{"title":"Online DPO: Online Direct Preference Optimization with Fast-Slow Chasing","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"qiOnlineDPOOnline2024.xml","metas":{"doi":"10.48550/ArXiv.2406.05534","external":"Https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05534","bibtex":"@Misc{qiOnlineDPOOnline2024,\n title = {Online {{DPO}}: {{Online Direct Preference Optimization}} with {{Fast-Slow Chasing}}},\n author = {Qi, Biqing and Li, Pengfei and Li, Fangyuan and Gao, Junqi and Zhang, Kaiyan and Zhou, Bowen},\n year = {2024},\n doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2406.05534},\n urldate = {2024-09-08},\n number = {arXiv:2406.05534},\n publisher = {arXiv},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/74CS8AIC/Qi et al. - 2024 - Online DPO Online Direct Preference Optimization with Fast-Slow Chasing.pdf},\n keywords = {Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,Computer Science - Computation and Language,Computer Science - Machine Learning},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n abstract = {Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) improves the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values by training directly on human preference datasets, eliminating the need for reward models.

These lecture notes celebrate the breadth of mathematical ideas that have led to tangible advancements in Monte Carlo methods and their applications. To accommodate a diverse audience, the level of mathematical rigor varies from chapter to chapter, giving only an intuitive treatment to the most technically demanding subjects. The aim is not to be comprehensive or encyclopedic, but rather to illustrate some key principles in the design and analysis of Monte Carlo methods through a carefully-crafted choice of topics that emphasizes timeless over timely ideas. Algorithms are presented in a way that is conducive to conceptual understanding and mathematical analysis -- clarity and intuition are favored over state-of-the-art implementations that are harder to comprehend or rely on ad-hoc heuristics. To help readers navigate the expansive landscape of Monte Carlo methods, each algorithm is accompanied by a summary of its pros and cons, and by a discussion of the type of problems for which they are most useful.

While a number of methods have been proposed to enable generic self-supervised RL, based on principles such as goal-conditioned RL, behavioral cloning, and unsupervised skill learning, such methods remain limited in terms of either the diversity of the discovered behaviors, the need for high-quality demonstration data, or the lack of a clear adaptation mechanism for downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised framework to pre-train generalist policies that capture diverse, optimal, long-horizon behaviors from unlabeled offline data such that they can be quickly adapted to any arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. Our key insight is to learn a structured representation that preserves the temporal structure of the underlying environment, and then to span this learned latent space with directional movements, which enables various zero-shot policy \"prompting\" schemes for downstream tasks. Through our experiments on simulated robotic locomotion and manipulation benchmarks, we show that our unsupervised policies can solve goal-conditioned and general RL tasks in a zero-shot fashion, even often outperforming prior methods designed specifically for each setting.

To our best knowledge, no prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of ZO optimization in training deep neural networks (DNNs) without a significant decrease in performance. To overcome this roadblock, we develop DeepZero, a principled ZO deep learning (DL) framework that can scale ZO optimization to DNN training from scratch through three primary innovations. First, we demonstrate the advantages of coordinatewise gradient estimation (CGE) over randomized vector-wise gradient estimation in training accuracy and computational efficiency. Second, we propose a sparsityinduced ZO training protocol that extends the model pruning methodology using only finite differences to explore and exploit the sparse DL prior in CGE. Third, we develop the methods of feature reuse and forward parallelization to advance the practical implementations of ZO training. Our extensive experiments show that DeepZero achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on ResNet-20 trained on CIFAR-10, approaching FO training performance for the first time. Furthermore, we show the practical utility of DeepZero in applications of certified adversarial defense and DL-based partial differential equation error correction, achieving 10-20\\% improvement over SOTA.

Moreover, responses in these datasets are often sampled from a language model distinct from the one being aligned, and since the model evolves over training, the alignment phase is inevitably off-policy. In this study, we posit that online feedback is key and improves DAP methods. Our method, online AI feedback (OAIF), uses an LLM as annotator: on each training iteration, we sample two responses from the current model and prompt the LLM annotator to choose which one is preferred, thus providing online feedback. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate via human evaluation in several tasks that OAIF outperforms both offline DAP and RLHF methods. We further show that the feedback leveraged in OAIF is easily controllable, via instruction prompts to the LLM annotator.},\n primaryclass = {cs},\n eprint = {2402.04792},\n month = {February}\n}"}},"fransUnsupervisedZeroShotReinforcement2024":{"title":"Unsupervised Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning via Functional Reward Encodings","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"fransUnsupervisedZeroShotReinforcement2024.xml","metas":{"doi":"10.48550/ArXiv.2402.17135","external":"Https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17135","bibtex":"@Misc{fransUnsupervisedZeroShotReinforcement2024,\n title = {Unsupervised {{Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning}} via {{Functional Reward Encodings}}},\n author = {Frans, Kevin and Park, Seohong and Abbeel, Pieter and Levine, Sergey},\n year = {2024},\n doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2402.17135},\n urldate = {2024-12-04},\n number = {arXiv:2402.17135},\n publisher = {arXiv},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/FUDVV3U4/Frans et al. - 2024 - Unsupervised Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning via Functional Reward Encodings.pdf},\n keywords = {Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,Computer Science - Machine Learning},\n langid = {english},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n abstract = {Can we pre-train a generalist agent from a large amount of unlabeled offline trajectories such that it can be immediately adapted to any new downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner?

Zeroth-order (ZO) methods can in principle estimate gradients using only two forward passes but are theorized to be catastrophically slow for optimizing large models. In this work, we propose a memory-efficient zerothorder optimizer (MeZO), adapting the classical ZO-SGD method to operate in-place, thereby fine-tuning LMs with the same memory footprint as inference. For example, with a single A100 80GB GPU, MeZO can train a 30-billion parameter model, whereas fine-tuning with backpropagation can train only a 2.7B LM with the same budget. We conduct comprehensive experiments across model types (masked and autoregressive LMs), model scales (up to 66B), and downstream tasks (classification, multiple-choice, and generation). Our results demonstrate that (1) MeZO significantly outperforms in-context learning and linear probing; (2) MeZO achieves comparable performance to fine-tuning with backpropagation across multiple tasks, with up to 12x memory reduction and up to 2x GPU-hour reduction in our implementation; (3) MeZO is compatible with both full-parameter and parameter-efficient tuning techniques such as LoRA and prefix tuning; (4) MeZO can effectively optimize non-differentiable objectives (e.g., maximizing accuracy or F1). We support our empirical findings with theoretical insights, highlighting how adequate pre-training and task prompts enable MeZO to fine-tune huge models, despite classical ZO analyses suggesting otherwise.},\n primaryclass = {cs},\n eprint = {2305.17333},\n month = {January}\n}"}},"degrisStepsizeOptimizationContinual2024":{"title":"Step-size Optimization for Continual Learning","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"degrisStepsizeOptimizationContinual2024.xml","metas":{"external":"Https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17401v1","bibtex":"@Misc{degrisStepsizeOptimizationContinual2024,\n title = {Step-Size {{Optimization}} for {{Continual Learning}}},\n author = {Degris, Thomas and Javed, Khurram and Sharifnassab, Arsalan and Liu, Yuxin and Sutton, Richard},\n year = {2024},\n urldate = {2024-09-06},\n howpublished = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17401v1},\n journal = {arXiv.org},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/YSGENB8H/Degris et al. - 2024 - Step-size Optimization for Continual Learning.pdf},\n langid = {english},\n abstract = {In continual learning, a learner has to keep learning from the data over its whole life time. A key issue is to decide what knowledge to keep and what knowledge to let go.

Common algorithms, like RMSProp and Adam, use heuristics, specifically normalization, to adapt this step-size vector. In this paper, we show that those heuristics ignore the effect of their adaptation on the overall objective function, for example by moving the step-size vector away from better step-size vectors. On the other hand, stochastic meta-gradient descent algorithms, like IDBD (Sutton, 1992), explicitly optimize the step-size vector with respect to the overall objective function. On simple problems, we show that IDBD is able to consistently improve step-size vectors, where RMSProp and Adam do not. We explain the differences between the two approaches and their respective limitations.

An approach to tackle this problem consists in selecting actions according to specific policies for an extended period of time, also known as options. A recent line of work to derive such exploratory options builds upon the eigenfunctions of the graph Laplacian. Importantly, until now these methods have been mostly limited to tabular domains where (1) the graph Laplacian matrix was either given or could be fully estimated, (2) performing eigendecomposition on this matrix was computationally tractable, and (3) value functions could be learned exactly. Additionally, these methods required a separate option discovery phase. These assumptions are fundamentally not scalable. In this paper we address these limitations and show how recent results for directly approximating the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian can be leveraged to truly scale up options-based exploration. To do so, we introduce a fully online deep RL algorithm for discovering Laplacianbased options and evaluate our approach on a variety of pixel-based tasks.

In this paper we bring these two perspectives together, empirically investigating the properties of representations that support transfer in reinforcement learning.

In reinforcement learning, this is often modeled through temporally extended courses of actions called options. Options allow agents to make predictions and to operate at different levels of abstraction within an environment. Nevertheless, approaches based on the options framework often start with the assumption that a reasonable set of options is known beforehand. When this is not the case, there are no definitive answers for which options one should consider. In this paper, we argue that the successor representation, which encodes states based on the pattern of state visitation that follows them, can be seen as a natural substrate for the discovery and use of temporal abstractions. To support our claim, we take a big picture view of recent results, showing how the successor representation can be used to discover options that facilitate either temporally-extended exploration or planning. We cast these results as instantiations of a general framework for option discovery in which the agent's representation is used to identify useful options, which are then used to further improve its representation. This results in a virtuous, never-ending, cycle in which both the representation and the options are constantly refined based on each other. Beyond option discovery itself, we also discuss how the successor representation allows us to augment a set of options into a combinatorially large counterpart without additional learning. This is achieved through the combination of previously learned options. Our empirical evaluation focuses on options discovered for temporally-extended exploration and on the use of the successor representation to combine them. Our results shed light on important design decisions involved in the definition of options and demonstrate the synergy of different methods based on the successor representation, such as eigenoptions and the option keyboard.},\n primaryclass = {cs},\n eprint = {2110.05740},\n month = {April}\n}"}},"touatiDoesZeroShotReinforcement2023":{"title":"Does Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning Exist?","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"touatiDoesZeroShotReinforcement2023.xml","metas":{"doi":"10.48550/ArXiv.2209.14935","external":"Https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14935","bibtex":"@Misc{touatiDoesZeroShotReinforcement2023,\n title = {Does {{Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning Exist}}?},\n author = {Touati, Ahmed and Rapin, J{\\'e}r{\\'e}my and Ollivier, Yann},\n year = {2023},\n doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2209.14935},\n urldate = {2024-09-18},\n number = {arXiv:2209.14935},\n publisher = {arXiv},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/GFV8I99T/Touati et al. - 2023 - Does Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning Exist.pdf;/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/9RA8LX73/2209.html},\n keywords = {Computer Science - Machine Learning},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n abstract = {A zero-shot RL agent is an agent that can solve any RL task in a given environment, instantly with no additional planning or learning, after an initial reward-free learning phase. This marks a shift from the reward-centric RL paradigm towards \"controllable\" agents that can follow arbitrary instructions in an environment. Current RL agents can solve families of related tasks at best, or require planning anew for each task. Strategies for approximate zero-shot RL ave been suggested using successor features (SFs) [BBQ+ 18] or forward-backward (FB) representations [TO21], but testing has been limited. After clarifying the relationships between these schemes, we introduce improved losses and new SF models, and test the viability of zero-shot RL schemes systematically on tasks from the Unsupervised RL benchmark [LYL+21]. To disentangle universal representation learning from exploration, we work in an offline setting and repeat the tests on several existing replay buffers. SFs appear to suffer from the choice of the elementary state features.

While deep RL should automatically acquire such good representations, prior work often finds that learning representations in an end-to-end fashion is unstable and instead equip RL algorithms with additional representation learning parts (e.g., auxiliary losses, data augmentation). How can we design RL algorithms that directly acquire good representations? In this paper, instead of adding representation learning parts to an existing RL algorithm, we show (contrastive) representation learning methods can be cast as RL algorithms in their own right. To do this, we build upon prior work and apply contrastive representation learning to action-labeled trajectories, in such a way that the (inner product of) learned representations exactly corresponds to a goal-conditioned value function. We use this idea to reinterpret a prior RL method as performing contrastive learning, and then use the idea to propose a much simpler method that achieves similar performance. Across a range of goal-conditioned RL tasks, we demonstrate that contrastive RL methods achieve higher success rates than prior non-contrastive methods, including in the offline RL setting. We also show that contrastive RL outperforms prior methods on image-based tasks, without using data augmentation or auxiliary objectives.},\n primaryclass = {cs},\n eprint = {2206.07568},\n month = {February}\n}"}},"huangReinforcementLearningLowRank2023":{"title":"Reinforcement Learning in Low-Rank MDPs with Density Features","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"huangReinforcementLearningLowRank2023.xml","metas":{"external":"Https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02252","bibtex":"@Misc{huangReinforcementLearningLowRank2023,\n title = {Reinforcement {{Learning}} in {{Low-Rank MDPs}} with {{Density Features}}},\n author = {Huang, Audrey and Chen, Jinglin and Jiang, Nan},\n year = {2023},\n urldate = {2024-09-16},\n number = {arXiv:2302.02252},\n publisher = {arXiv},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/JV6TZ7S9/Huang et al. - 2023 - Reinforcement Learning in Low-Rank MDPs with Density Features.pdf},\n keywords = {Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,Computer Science - Machine Learning,Statistics - Machine Learning},\n langid = {english},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n abstract = {MDPs with low-rank transitions---that is, the transition matrix can be factored into the product of two matrices, left and right---is a highly representative structure that enables tractable learning.

We define safety as the agent remaining in a desired safe set with high probability during the operation time. The drawbacks of this formulation are twofold. The problem is non-convex and computing the gradients of the constraints with respect to the policies is prohibitive. Hence, we propose an ergodic relaxation of the constraints with the following advantages. (i) The safety guarantees are maintained in the case of episodic tasks and they hold until a given time horizon for continuing tasks. (ii) The constrained optimization problem despite its non-convexity has arbitrarily small duality gap if the parametrization of the controller is rich enough. (iii) The gradients of the Lagrangian associated to the safe learning problem can be computed using standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) results and stochastic approximation tools. Leveraging these advantages, we exploit primal-dual algorithms to find policies that are safe and optimal. We test the proposed approach in a navigation task in a continuous domain.

One hypothesis to explain this is that overparameterized deep networks enjoy the benefits of implicit regularization induced by stochastic gradient descent, which favors parsimonious solutions that generalize well on test inputs. It is reasonable to surmise that deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods could also benefit from this effect. In this paper, we discuss how the implicit regularization effect of SGD seen in supervised learning could in fact be harmful in the offline deep RL setting, leading to poor generalization and degenerate feature representations. Our theoretical analysis shows that when existing models of implicit regularization are applied to temporal difference learning, the resulting derived regularizer favors degenerate solutions with excessive ``aliasing'', in stark contrast to the supervised learning case. We back up these findings empirically, showing that feature representations learned by a deep network value function trained via bootstrapping can indeed become degenerate, aliasing the representations for state-action pairs that appear on either side of the Bellman backup. To address this issue, we derive the form of this implicit regularizer and, inspired by this derivation, propose a simple and effective explicit regularizer, called DR3, that counteracts the undesirable effects of this implicit regularizer. When combined with existing offline RL methods, DR3 substantially improves performance and stability, alleviating unlearning in Atari 2600 games, D4RL domains and robotic manipulation from images.},\n primaryclass = {cs},\n eprint = {2112.04716},\n month = {December},\n shorttitle = {{{DR3}}}\n}"}},"touatiLearningOneRepresentation2021":{"title":"Learning One Representation to Optimize All Rewards","taxon":"Reference","tags":["paper","todo"],"route":"touatiLearningOneRepresentation2021.xml","metas":{"doi":"10.48550/ArXiv.2103.07945","external":"Https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07945","bibtex":"@Misc{touatiLearningOneRepresentation2021,\n title = {Learning {{One Representation}} to {{Optimize All Rewards}}},\n author = {Touati, Ahmed and Ollivier, Yann},\n year = {2021},\n doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2103.07945},\n urldate = {2024-09-18},\n number = {arXiv:2103.07945},\n publisher = {arXiv},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/FN8MPGES/Touati and Ollivier - 2021 - Learning One Representation to Optimize All Rewards.pdf;/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/SXVNRKWC/2103.html},\n keywords = {Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,Computer Science - Machine Learning,Mathematics - Optimization and Control},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n abstract = {We introduce the forward-backward (FB) representation of the dynamics of a reward-free Markov decision process.

During an unsupervised phase, we use reward-free interactions with the environment to learn two representations via off-the-shelf deep learning methods and temporal difference (TD) learning. In the test phase, a reward representation is estimated either from observations or an explicit reward description (e.g., a target state). The optimal policy for that reward is directly obtained from these representations, with no planning. We assume access to an exploration scheme or replay buffer for the first phase. The corresponding unsupervised loss is well-principled: if training is perfect, the policies obtained are provably optimal for any reward function. With imperfect training, the sub-optimality is proportional to the unsupervised approximation error. The FB representation learns long-range relationships between states and actions, via a predictive occupancy map, without having to synthesize states as in model-based approaches.

Yet, the majority of current HRL methods require careful task-specific design and on-policy training, making them difficult to apply in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we study how we can develop HRL algorithms that are general, in that they do not make onerous additional assumptions beyond standard RL algorithms, and efficient, in the sense that they can be used with modest numbers of interaction samples, making them suitable for real-world problems such as robotic control. For generality, we develop a scheme where lower-level controllers are supervised with goals that are learned and proposed automatically by the higher-level controllers. To address efficiency, we propose to use off-policy experience for both higher and lower-level training. This poses a considerable challenge, since changes to the lower-level behaviors change the action space for the higher-level policy, and we introduce an off-policy correction to remedy this challenge. This allows us to take advantage of recent advances in off-policy model-free RL to learn both higher- and lower-level policies using substantially fewer environment interactions than on-policy algorithms. We term the resulting HRL agent HIRO and find that it is generally applicable and highly sample-efficient. Our experiments show that HIRO can be used to learn highly complex behaviors for simulated robots, such as pushing objects and utilizing them to reach target locations, learning from only a few million samples, equivalent to a few days of real-time interaction.

Simulations show that noise-contrastive estimation offers the best trade-off between computational and statistical efficiency.

To address them, we introduce the Constraint-Conditioned Policy Optimization (CCPO) framework, consisting of two key modules: (1) Versatile Value Estimation (VVE) for approximating value functions under unseen threshold conditions, and (2) Conditioned Variational Inference (CVI) for encoding arbitrary constraint thresholds during policy optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CCPO outperforms the baselines in terms of safety and task performance, while preserving zero-shot adaptation capabilities to different constraint thresholds data-efficiently. This makes our approach suitable for real-world dynamic applications.}\n}"}},"eysenbach2023":{"title":"Constrastive Learning as Goal Conditioned Reinforcement Learning","taxon":"Reference","tags":["contrastive"],"route":"eysenbach2023.xml","metas":{"abstract":"In reinforcement learning (RL), it is easier to solve a task if\n              given a good representation.

Streaming learning, the modus operandi of classic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like Q-learning and TD, mimics natural learning by using the most recent sample without storing it. This approach is also ideal for resource-constrained, communication-limited, and privacy-sensitive applications. However, in deep RL, learners almost always use batch updates and replay buffers, making them computationally expensive and incompatible with streaming learning. Although the prevalence of batch deep RL is often attributed to its sample efficiency, a more critical reason for the absence of streaming deep RL is its frequent instability and failure to learn, which we refer to as stream barrier. This paper introduces the stream-x algorithms, the first class of deep RL algorithms to overcome stream barrier for both prediction and control and match sample efficiency of batch RL. Through experiments in Mujoco Gym, DM Control, and Atari Games, we demonstrate stream barrier in existing algorithms and successful stable learning with our stream-x algorithms: stream Q, stream AC, and stream TD, achieving the best model-free performance in DM Control Dog environments. A set of common techniques underlies the stream-x algorithms, enabling their success with a single set of hyperparameters and allowing for easy extension to other algorithms, thereby reviving streaming RL.}\n}"}},"coverELEMENTSINFORMATIONTHEORY":{"title":"ELEMENTS OF INFORMATION THEORY","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"coverELEMENTSINFORMATIONTHEORY.xml","metas":{"bibtex":"@Article{coverELEMENTSINFORMATIONTHEORY,\n title = {{{ELEMENTS OF INFORMATION THEORY}}},\n author = {Cover, Thomas M and Thomas, Joy A},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/C6AJGW5I/Cover and Thomas - ELEMENTS OF INFORMATION THEORY.pdf},\n langid = {english}\n}"}},"zisselmanExploreGeneralizeZeroShot":{"title":"Explore to Generalize in Zero-Shot RL","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"zisselmanExploreGeneralizeZeroShot.xml","metas":{"bibtex":"@Article{zisselmanExploreGeneralizeZeroShot,\n title = {Explore to {{Generalize}} in {{Zero-Shot RL}}},\n author = {Zisselman, Ev and Lavie, Itai and Soudry, Daniel and Tamar, Aviv},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/9D7NJ4H9/Zisselman et al. - Explore to Generalize in Zero-Shot RL.pdf},\n langid = {english},\n abstract = {We study zero-shot generalization in reinforcement learning---optimizing a policy on a set of training tasks to perform well on a similar but unseen test task. To mitigate overfitting, previous work explored different notions of invariance to the task. However, on problems such as the ProcGen Maze, an adequate solution that is invariant to the task visualization does not exist, and therefore invariance-based approaches fail. Our insight is that learning a policy that effectively explores the domain is harder to memorize than a policy that maximizes reward for a specific task, and therefore we expect such learned behavior to generalize well; we indeed demonstrate this empirically on several domains that are difficult for invariancebased approaches. Our Explore to Generalize algorithm (ExpGen) builds on this insight: we train an additional ensemble of agents that optimize reward. At test time, either the ensemble agrees on an action, and we generalize well, or we take exploratory actions, which generalize well and drive us to a novel part of the state space, where the ensemble may potentially agree again. We show that our approach is the state-of-the-art on tasks of the ProcGen challenge that have thus far eluded effective generalization, yielding a success rate of 83\\% on the Maze task and 74\\% on Heist with 200 training levels. ExpGen can also be combined with an invariance based approach to gain the best of both worlds, setting new state-of-the-art results on ProcGen.

One of the key difficulties is insufficient exploration, resulting in an agent being unable to learn robust policies. Intrinsically motivated agents can explore new behavior for their own sake rather than to directly solve external goals. Such intrinsic behaviors could eventually help the agent solve tasks posed by the environment. We present hierarchicalDQN (h-DQN), a framework to integrate hierarchical action-value functions, operating at different temporal scales, with goal-driven intrinsically motivated deep reinforcement learning. A top-level q-value function learns a policy over intrinsic goals, while a lower-level function learns a policy over atomic actions to satisfy the given goals. h-DQN allows for flexible goal specifications, such as functions over entities and relations. This provides an efficient space for exploration in complicated environments. We demonstrate the strength of our approach on two problems with very sparse and delayed feedback: (1) a complex discrete stochastic decision process with stochastic transitions, and (2) the classic ATARI game --`Montezuma's Revenge'.}\n}"}},"vershyninHighDimensionalProbability":{"title":"High-Dimensional Probability","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"vershyninHighDimensionalProbability.xml","metas":{"bibtex":"@Article{vershyninHighDimensionalProbability,\n title = {High-{{Dimensional Probability}}},\n author = {Vershynin, Roman},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/DC3KWF38/Vershynin - High-Dimensional Probability.pdf},\n langid = {english}\n}"}},"kak-0001":{"title":"Kellen Kanarios","taxon":null,"tags":["home"],"route":"index.xml","metas":{"author":"False"}},"kellenkanarios":{"title":"Kellen Kanarios","taxon":"Person","tags":[],"route":"kellenkanarios.xml","metas":{"external":"Https://kellenkanarios.github.io/","institution":"[University of Michigan]","position":"PhD Student"}},"borgersLectureNotesGame":{"title":"Lecture Notes on Game Theory","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"borgersLectureNotesGame.xml","metas":{"bibtex":"@Article{borgersLectureNotesGame,\n title = {Lecture {{Notes}} on {{Game Theory}}},\n author = {Borgers, Tilman},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/CYJDCVHC/Borgers - Lecture Notes on Game Theory.pdf},\n langid = {english}\n}"}},"leiying":{"title":"Lei Ying","taxon":"Person","tags":[],"route":"leiying.xml","metas":{"external":"Https://leiying.engin.umich.edu/","institution":"University of Michigan","position":"Professor"}},"algebra":{"title":"Math 494 Notes","taxon":"Reference","tags":["texnote"],"route":"algebra.xml","metas":{"external":"Notes/494-note.pdf"}},"analysis":{"title":"Math 395 Notes","taxon":"Reference","tags":["texnote"],"route":"analysis.xml","metas":{"external":"Notes/395-note.pdf"}},"functional":{"title":"Math 602 Notes","taxon":"Reference","tags":["texnote"],"route":"functional.xml","metas":{"external":"Notes/602-note.pdf"}},"measure":{"title":"Math 597 Notes","taxon":"Reference","tags":["texnote"],"route":"measure.xml","metas":{"external":"Notes/597-note.pdf"}},"nanjiang":{"title":"Nan Jiang","taxon":"Person","tags":[],"route":"nanjiang.xml","metas":{"external":"Https://nanjiang.cs.illinois.edu/","institution":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","position":"Professor"}},"nachum2019":{"title":"Near Optimal Representation Learning for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning","taxon":"Reference","tags":["contrastive","potw"],"route":"nachum2019.xml","metas":{"bibtex":"@Misc{nachum2019nearoptimalrepresentationlearninghierarchical,\n      title={Near-Optimal Representation Learning for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning}, \n      author={Ofir Nachum and Shixiang Gu and Honglak Lee and Sergey Levine},\n      year={2019},\n      eprint={1810.01257},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.AI},\n      url={https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01257}, \n}"}},"gutmann2012":{"title":"Noise-contrastive Estimation","taxon":"Reference","tags":["contrastive"],"route":"gutmann2012.xml","metas":{"abstract":"We present a new estimation principle for parameterized statistical models. The idea is to perform nonlinear logistic regression to discriminate between the observed data and some artificially generated noise, using the model log-density function in the regression nonlinearity.  We show that this leads to a consistent (convergent) estimator of the parameters, and analyze the asymptotic variance.  In particular, the method is shown to directly work for unnormalized models, i.e. models where the density function does not integrate to one. The normalization constant can be estimated just like any other parameter. For a tractable ICA model, we compare the method with other estimation methods that can be used to learn unnormalized models, including score matching, contrastive divergence, and maximum-likelihood where the normalization constant is estimated with importance sampling. Simulations show that noise-contrastive estimation offers the best trade-off between computational and statistical efficiency. The method is then applied to the modeling of natural images: We show that the method can successfully estimate a large-scale two-layer model and a Markov random field.","bibtex":"@InProceedings{pmlr-v9-gutmann10a,\n  title = \t {Noise-contrastive estimation: A new estimation principle for unnormalized statistical models},\n  author = \t {Gutmann, Michael and Hyvärinen, Aapo},\n  booktitle = \t {Proceedings of the Thirteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics},\n  pages = \t {297--304},\n  year = \t {2010},\n  editor = \t {Teh, Yee Whye and Titterington, Mike},\n  volume = \t {9},\n  series = \t {Proceedings of Machine Learning Research},\n  address = \t {Chia Laguna Resort, Sardinia, Italy},\n  month = \t {13--15 May},\n  publisher =    {PMLR},\n  pdf = \t {http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/gutmann10a/gutmann10a.pdf},\n  url = \t {https://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/gutmann10a.html},\n}"}},"huangOccupancybasedPolicyGradient":{"title":"Occupancy-based Policy Gradient: Estimation, Convergence, and Optimality","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"huangOccupancybasedPolicyGradient.xml","metas":{"bibtex":"@Article{huangOccupancybasedPolicyGradient,\n title = {Occupancy-Based {{Policy Gradient}}: {{Estimation}}, {{Convergence}}, and {{Optimality}}},\n author = {Huang, Audrey and Jiang, Nan},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/P7NI2N95/Huang and Jiang - Occupancy-based Policy Gradient Estimation, Convergence, and Optimality.pdf},\n langid = {english},\n abstract = {Occupancy functions play an instrumental role in reinforcement learning (RL) for guiding exploration, handling distribution shift, and optimizing general objectives beyond the expected return. Yet, computationally efficient policy optimization methods that use (only) occupancy functions are virtually non-existent. In this paper, we establish the theoretical foundations of model-free policy gradient (PG) methods that compute the gradient through the occupancy for both online and offline RL, without modeling value functions. Our algorithms reduce gradient estimation to squared-loss regression and are computationally oracle-efficient. We characterize the sample complexities of both local and global convergence, accounting for both finite-sample estimation error and the roles of exploration (online) and data coverage (offline). Occupancy-based PG naturally handles arbitrary offline data distributions, and, with one-line algorithmic changes, can be adapted to optimize any differentiable objective functional.}\n}"}},"jaakkolaConvergenceStochasticIterative":{"title":"On the Convergence of Stochastic Iterative Dynamic Programming Algorithms","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"jaakkolaConvergenceStochasticIterative.xml","metas":{"bibtex":"@Article{jaakkolaConvergenceStochasticIterative,\n title = {On the {{Convergence}} of {{Stochastic Iterative Dynamic Programming Algorithms}}},\n author = {Jaakkola, Tommi and Jordan, Michael I and Singh, Satinder P},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/95ZWX95X/Jaakkola et al. - On the Convergence of Stochastic Iterative Dynamic Programming Algorithms.pdf},\n langid = {english},\n abstract = {Recent developments in the area of reinforcement learning have yielded a number of new algorithms for the prediction and control of Markovian environments.
